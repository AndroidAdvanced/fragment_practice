Topic : Kotlin Flow

what is kotlin flow?
What is need of it?

Why coroutine?
It help to implement asynchronous, non blocking code - for this we use suspend function.
 for network call, database operation, task that  return single value
we want to execute code asynchronously.
so that thread doesnt block.
We make suspend function for that and launch it through coroutine.
Suspend function return single object

Launch : We dont expect result to come, for that we use launch

suspend fun deleteUser() {
     CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
            // network call
     }	
}

Await :

 suspend fun createUser() {
      val user = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).async {
       // network call
       }	
       return user.await()
}
example: insert some data
