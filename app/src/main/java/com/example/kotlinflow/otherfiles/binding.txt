View Binding : 
--------------------
1.  Create Binding Object
2.  Initialize Binding Object in onCreateView
3.  set binding to null in onDestroyView
It is done compile time

Benefits : 
-------------------
no need to use findViewById
Threre is no scope of null reference

spinKitView for loader


Data Binding
-----------------
Support Library to bind UI components to data source
using declarative format.

If data model value changes, it directly reflected on view

Data binding done at compile time
no need to use findviewbyid
No memory leaks

set data binding to true in gradle

xml file starts with layout
<data> </data>

activity_main -> ActivityMainBinding

we need to set binding property to model class

create quote variable in xml

Quote()

binding.quote = Quote()



Difference
ViewBinding is subset of data binding,
but view binding is heavy library and it causes heavy compile time.


View Binding : Advantage is speed and effieciency,  Build time is faster, because 
 Data Binding : build time is slower, because annotation processor affecting its build time

View Binding : we can not bind layout with data, no binding adapters, no two way binding, no variable declaration in xml
Data Binding : it supports above


View Binding : 
Data Binding : it works with observable, so automatic data refresh when model
        value changes

View Binding : its functionality is to bind view in code
