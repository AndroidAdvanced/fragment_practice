WithContext & RunBlocking
-----------------------------------

Launch is non blocking
WithContext is blocking nature, code runs sequentially
We compulsory need to pass disptacher in withContext

Coroutine doesn't block thread, it executes next line

Runblocking : Untill coroutine executes, it blocks thread


ViewModelScope
----------------------
Coroutine scope attached with your viewmodels
All coroutine cancelled automatically when viewmodel is cleared,
we don't need to manually cancel coroutine

LifeCycleScope
-------------------
 Coroutine scope attached with lifecycle :  activity or fragments
Coroutine cancelled when lifecycle (activity or fragment) cancels,
we don't need to manually cancel the coroutine
