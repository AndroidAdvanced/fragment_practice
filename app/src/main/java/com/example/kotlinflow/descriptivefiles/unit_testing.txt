Topic : Unit Testing

What is Unit Testing?
--------------------------

It doesn't mean to test single class, or single function

It refer to unit in your code

unit could be function, class or module, or even multiple class working together
as long as its related behaviour
Goal is to isolate different parts of the software

What is Mockito?
----------------------


our test case should fail for what we have written,
it shouln't fail due to external reasons.

Lets say if we want to test Class A, and it has dependency of Class B 
in this case, we can mock object of class B. we can say create fake object

We can have deterministic output : becuase we defined behaviour of 
fake object, so our test cases would be realistic
